# Radar Signal Noise Filtering

This project simulates a noisy radar signal and applies a low-pass filter to reduce the noise, resulting in a clearer signal.

## Project Overview
Radar systems often encounter noise that affects signal clarity. This project demonstrates how a Butterworth low-pass filter can effectively reduce noise in radar signals, allowing for better analysis and visualization.

## Features
- Simulates a radar signal with added random noise.
- Implements a Butterworth low-pass filter for noise reduction.
- Visualizes the original, noisy, and filtered signals.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used for simulation and filtering.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing signals.
- **SciPy**: To implement the Butterworth filter.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evrenbaris/radar-noise-filtering.git
   cd radar-noise-filtering
